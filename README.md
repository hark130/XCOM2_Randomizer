# XCOM2_Randomizer
This is a python script to randomize XCOM2 character customizations for me

## TO DO
	[ ] Expand on Character Info
    	[ ] Backstory function incorporates 'majority dead' in narrative
    	[ ] Implement other racial first names (male and female)
    	[ ] Implement other racial last names
    	[ ] Implement other racial city lists
    	[ ] Implement family into background, dead or alive
    [ ] Expand on Props
    	[ ] Establish color selection for tattoos (implement color wheel?)
    	[ ] Armor style ADVENT only gets long sleeve arms
    [ ] Refactor dictionary into a class
    	[ ] Utilize members instead of variables to influence decisions
    		[ ] Any 'Muton' armor gets 'Muton' mask or 'Muton' face paint
    		[ ] Allows for easier themed creation
    		[ ] Colors better matched based on established color scheme
    		[ ] People with XCOM in their backstory have an increased chance for an XCOM tattoo
