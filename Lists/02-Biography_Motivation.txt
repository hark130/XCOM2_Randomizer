<name> joined out of love for freedom and liberty.
<name> hates the aliens, plain and simple.
<name> appears to be on a mission to prove <his/her> combat prowess and leadership ability through the fight against the ADVENT.
Narrowly escaping previous imprisonment, <name> is afraid to ever go back.  <he/she> would rather die fighting than rot away in a prison.
<name> seemingly needs to fight against this alien occupation.
<name> upholds the ideals <his/her> country was originally founded on and can't sit back while the aliens subvert that national pride.
<name> doesn't think we can win this fight but has vowed to die trying.
<name> seems to have a disturbing collection of severed viper tongues.  What better way to add to the collection than to join XCOM as a field agent.
<name> joined a local resistance cell after ADVENT issued an unfounded warrant for his arrest.
<name> won't speak of <his/her> motivation for joining XCOM but few volunteers are more dedicated to the cause than <him/her>.  There is no doubt as to where <his/her> loyalty lies.
<name> joined XCOM with the fervent hope that Dr. Tygan might help <him/her> search for family members that have been taken by ADVENT.
After learning some secret details regarding the Avatar Project, <name> immediately brought them to the attention of the resistance.  Discovered by ADVENT forces, <he/she> can never return to their normal life again.  Instead, they have joined the fight.
<name> sought out XCOM scientists for medical treatment after being rescued from an ADVENT indoctrination facility.  Dr. Tygan was able to help <name> recover and <he/she> has stayed on to fight back ever since.
<name> discovered a new weapon the ADVENT Administration has been researching and has brought it to the attention of local rebel forces.  Since <his/her> treachery has been discovered, <he/she> has had no choice but to join the resistance against these alien invaders.
A close friend of <name>'s was killed in cold blood by a local ADVENT Trooper.  Angry with grief, <name> sought out a nearby resistance cell to stop this from ever happening again.
<name>'s hometown was brutally attacked for no known reason.  Barely escaping alive, <he/she> joined the nearest resistance cell to stop that from ever happening again.
<name>'s apartment building was taken captive, enmasse, while <he/she> was out.  Fearful of <his/her> life, <he/she> had no choice but to join the battle against tyranny.
An epidemic ripped through <names>'s population center, killing thousands.  The ADVENT Administration merely blockaded the subdivision to let the disease run its course.  Thousands died.  Not only did <name> survive the plauge but <he/she> also managed to escape.  The truth was spread and <name> joined a local resistance cell shortly after.
After discovering <his/her> spouse was an ADVENT Forces informant, the shame drove <name> to join XCOM in the fight against the aliens.
Feeling shame upon discovering <his/her> spouse was unfaithful with a local ADVENT Officer, <name> assassinated the officer and joined the rebellion.
Previously a wealthy citizen, all of <name>'s worldly possessions were taken by the local ADVENT forces.  This drove <him/her> into the welcoming arms of the local rebels and eventually XCOM.
A shift in the administration's taxation has caused unrest and <name> was swept up into the riots and fighting that ensued.  Joining anti-alien rebels was an inevitable next step.
Corruption rumors abound in the local ADVENT Administration, <name> was searching for evidence of murder and treachery.  <his/her> search eventually led <him/her> to XCOM.
A local religious figure was rumored to have been killed, exiled, or worse.  <name> decided that the aliens had to pay.
New ADVENT sanctions were announced, causing a radical shift in the local population's mood.  <name> had finally had enough and decided to join the fight.
<name> took up arms because <his/her> deepest wish is for humanity to live in peace one day.
More than anything, <name> wanted a new direction in life so <he/she> gave up her old life to take up arms against the ADVENT Administration. 
<name> has joined the resistance for mysterious reasons but Central Officer Bradford vouches for <him/her>.
<name> left everything behind when an ADVENT operation destroyed the aparment building <he/she> owned.  Now <he/she> fights against the alien oppression.
<name> was secretly compiling information on alien and ADVENT operations around the globe until his data store was taken.  He came to XCOM with the intel he could remember and continues his work while not in the field.
<name>'s family were injured during an ADVENT raid in his subdivision and it was more than <he/she> could bear.  Moving them to a resistance camp for safety and joining XCOM was the only choice left.
<name> was previously employed in an ADVENT processing facility.  Haunted by the thousands of souls that have disappeared into ADVENT facilities, <he/she> could no long stand to work for such a shady organization.  Taking what information <he/she> could, <he/she> joined a local resistance cell and eventually was recruited into XCOM.
Damage to a nearby ADVENT facility was the final straw that caused <name> to see the light.  Whatever ADVENT was guarding inside caused a large outbreak of virulent plague.  Abandoning <his/her> now infected home, <he/she> sought out the rebels to fight against the evils perpetrated by the aliens.
<name> was doing well, financially.  In an unexplained seizure, ADVENT forces emptied <his/her> accounts leaving <him/her> without any money.  Penniless, <name> decided to rise up.
<name> successfully managed a growing art collection as a side hobby in <his/her> spare time.  Inexplicably, all of <his/her> art work were either taken or ruined by a local ADVENT Officer.  Disgruntled, <he/she> took up the sword and was eventually recruited into XCOM.
ADVENT raids into <name>'s rural town have left many buildings damaged and the local farms infertile.  Many people left but, in that moment, <name> decided to join the fight against their alien overlords and joined the resistance.
ADVENT paranoia has resulted in too many innocent people being accidentally killed.  <name> decided it was time to put a stop to it.  When good people fail to act, evil flourishes.
Wronfully jailed, <name>'s imprisonment and interrogation ironically turned <him/her> into the thing the ADVENT was searching for.
Tricked by an ADVENT Officer, <name> suffered significant monetary loss.  With <his/her> good name tarnished, the deception spurred <him/her> into action.  <name> has been fighting against the ADVENT Administration ever since.
